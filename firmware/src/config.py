Application configuration with dev/prod environment support.

Loads configuration from device.env and provides a singleton config instance
that can be imported throughout the application.

Environment variable ENV in device.env controls which profile is loaded:
- ENV=dev: Development settings (short timeouts, debug device name)
- ENV=prod (or not set): Production settings (standard timeouts)
